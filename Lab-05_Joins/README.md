# 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement **INNER JOIN operations** for retrieving meaningful data from multiple related tables using primary–foreign key relationships.

This lab focuses on:

- Multi-table data retrieval  
- Use of table aliases  
- Analytical queries with `GROUP BY`  
- Filtering & sorting using `JOIN`  
- Read-only SQL queries (no table modification)

---

# 🗂 Database Tables Used

This lab is based on:

- Lab 02 – ER Model to Relational Schema  
- Lab 03 – Data Insertion  

### Tables Used:

- `Department`
- `Student`
- `Faculty`
- `Course`
- `Enrollment`

---

# 🔗 INNER JOIN Concept

**INNER JOIN** returns only those records that have matching values in both tables.

### Example Query

```sql
SELECT S.Name, C.CourseName
FROM Student S
INNER JOIN Enrollment E
ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
INNER JOIN Course C
ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```

# 🧩 Lab Implementation Breakdown

## 🔹 Part A – Student & Enrollment Relationship
- Displayed student details with enrolled courses  
- Retrieved semester and grade information  

## 🔹 Part B – Course & Faculty Relationship
- Displayed course name with faculty  
- Retrieved faculty designation with courses  

## 🔹 Part C – Student–Course–Enrollment JOIN
- Joined three tables together  
- Extracted combined academic information  

## 🔹 Part D – Department-Based JOIN Queries
- Linked students and faculty with department details  
- Displayed department-wise course list  

## 🔹 Part E – Filtering & Sorting with JOIN
- Applied `WHERE` clause with JOIN  
- Used `ORDER BY` for sorting  

## 🔹 Part F – Analytical JOIN Queries
- Counted students enrolled in each course  
- Counted courses taught by each faculty  
- Department-wise student count  
- Retrieved maximum grade per course
