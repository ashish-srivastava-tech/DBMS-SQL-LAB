# Lab 03 – Database Table Implementation Using SQL and CSV Data

## Objective
To implement relational database tables using SQL and populate them using structured CSV data files.

## Description
In this lab, database tables are created using SQL scripts.  
Sample data is provided in CSV format and represents actual records for different database entities such as Student, Department, Course, Faculty, and Enrollment.

The lab demonstrates practical implementation of relational schema and handling structured data for database population.
